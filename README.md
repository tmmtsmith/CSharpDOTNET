CSharpDOTNET
============

This contains various code for C# tools - some of these are not complete projects, and those that aren't will list the assemblies needed.

Also contains UI c-tests.

**Note:**

Some code will now be private for followers only on a Google Drive.  To have access to this code, follow me on GitHub, send me an email with the subject of "Follow" with an email that also shows on your GitHub profile, and you'll be added to the private Google Drive repository.  When GitHub allows this feature to reward followers, this repository will move back to GitHub.  Thanks!
